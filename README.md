# random-info

You can use this piece of code to generate any kind of random information for a any number of people you need in csv format!
The original code includes name, service, ip and timestamp.
you can replace any other things you want 
initialy faker library was used but for better customation, i added an array of name, so you can comment it and use fake.name()
